continuous integration normally adds checks at various levels and at the same time it would be moving forward in the build-release pipeline

checks like standard, syntax, automation testing and feedback loops are created

these are stages, at every stage there would be a notification channel so at any stage fails or if test fails we notify developers

i get to know where my code is in the pipeline and i exactly know when my code is going live.
