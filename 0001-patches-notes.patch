+Patch is a text file, whose contents are similar to Git diff, but along with code, it also has metadata about commits; e.g., commit ID, date, commit message, etc. We can create a patch from commits and other people can apply them to their repository.
+
+One can create a patch and then send that patch to other users and these users can apply the patch on their local repo 
+
+To create a patch git format-patch for the latest commit
+
+you can also specify a commit id if you want to create a patch for that commit.
+
+The above command creates .patch files inside the current working directory. 
+
+now this patch can be send over to other user to apply the patch 
+
+patches can be applied through two commands
+
+git am git apply
+
+git aplly :- applies the patch to the local repo without creating a commit
+
+git am :- applies the patch and creates the commit at the same time
