how to use environment variables to safely store and use your credentials within Jenkins jobs

you should have the plugin credentials binding


Let's suppose we have a job that uploads somefile to an FTP server

to authenticate against the FTP server we would need some sort of Id and password

we can store this password in jenkins and can have environment variables against these username and password which we can parse it in our jobs

In order to add a username and password

then navigate to credentials--> store --> Jenkins store and then go to global credentials and click on add credentials

Once added credential are saved in jenkins

And now in the job we have to select build environment select Use secret texts or files

Once you select this there is a new option that says bindings

and then click on add and add username and password (separated)

Now provide the variable name for your username and password

you can use this variable name in your build steps by providing $ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE

note :- If you use environment variable for your username and password you cannot see the value for these variables in the console output once the job runs
