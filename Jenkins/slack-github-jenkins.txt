you can also integrate jenkins with slack and github with their respective plugin

for slack it is slack notifier plugin

Once installed you will need a token id which you can go to your slack workspace

Create a new channel and integarate that with jenkins

That will give you the token that is needed to configure

Once done you can add that token as  a secret text and then the job can be configured to send post build notification to slack channel

And the same can be done via github

we can create a webhook from github to start a job

We need git integration plugin to be installed on our machine and once done you can use this plugin to build on every commit

in the webhook URL append it with "github-webhook"
