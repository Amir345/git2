Integrate Jenkins with BitBucket Build Status API

By this you can check the respective job status as per the commit

in order to integrate it we would need oauth credentials

under your profile for your bitbucket setings and then uder access management select oauth 

In call back URL select Jenkins URL and once configured you will get a key and a secret key for it

Now, we have to go to jenkins and install the bitbucket build status notifier and bitbucket oauth plugin on the jenkins

Once done we have to add a post buildjob wheren we will select bit bucket notify build status

and in order to send notifications to bitbucket jenkins needs to authenticate first

so in to the advanced field provide the credentials

In the username field enter the key value from oauth credentials from bitbucket

and in password select the value for secret
