for .net project jenkins does not have anything out of the box

In jave we have pom.xml where in all the references for the maven project are available in pom.xml file

Nuget is a tool which can be used to add reference to your project 

Where in Nunit is used for eexcuting testing

Jenkins has no idea about Nuget or Nunit and we have to inform jenkins on what it does


In C# project in jenkins if you want to test something the general syntax using Nunit is

nunit <dll file>

but before testing one has to compile the project

In order to compile you have to have msbuild plugin installed on your jenkins machine and once you have the plugin you must have msbuild installed on your machine

that can be done via chocolatey package manager

Once done configure jenkins to use this via the global tool configuration 

also while configuring the msbuild you can specify the buildfile which is the solution file


You also need nuget for reference to restore and then use nunit

You can use this in build steps using the .exe file and run the relevant command using batch script and that would work
