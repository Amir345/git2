**********************Jenkins**********************************

Jenkins is a Java application, since it is Java application it is platform independent

Hence you can use it on multiple environments.

It is used for continuous integration and continous delivery

***************************************************************

Continuos integration :- we have different developer working on a project, and they make multiple commit on the shared repo (git, bitbucket, svn)

through the entire day there would be multiple commits and when we build the app and if there is a bug in that it would be difficult to troubleshoot and the build would fail

we have to go through the entire source code to find the bug and resolve this

Jenkins/CI resolves this problem

as soon as any developer commit the code in the repo jenkins would pull this commit (including the previous code) and would create the build

in case there is any problem with the build you would be notified about the failure hence you can go ahead and check that particular commit and would rollback

*****************************************************************

We can also integrate our unit test. performance test along with the build as a post build actions

so as soon as the build is created it will trigger some test on the build and if the test fails you will be notified for the same

******************************************************************


how to download jenkins :- Download Jenkins war file - https://jenkins.io/

Once you download that you can install that via the below command

#java -jar jenkins.war

and this would install a standalone application for jenkins on the machine and it can be access over the machine IP address or local host on port 8080 and it would store all the configuration in (.jenkins) folder

In case you want to change the port # we have to go by the below command

#Java -jar jenkins.war --httpPort=$port#

Jenkins show it's cool dashboard using the Jetty web server

However you can also use any other webserver that runs on Java framework such as Apache Tomcat

In order to get it installed as an application on any webserver we have to simply place the .war file in the webapps folder and then run the startup.bat or startup.bash from the bin folder depending on the OS that you have.

for bash scripts you might have to add the executable permissions

chmod +x *.sh in the bin folder in the apache tomcat

note:- startup script is to start the tomcat server and shutdown is used to close the tomcat server

Pre-requisite

tomcat version should be 5 or above
In order to run tomcat server on the windows machine JAVA (Java 7 or above) should be installed on the machine, and the JAVA_HOME and JRE_HOME variable should be there as environmental variable

Benefits of running jenkins in tomcat is that we can have all the applications at one server



Now, point to remember when we install Jenkins via the above commands or process no jenkins user would be created nor any service would be created

while installing it on an ubuntu box if we go through the below command

wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins-ci.org.key | sudo apt-key add -
sudo sh -c 'echo deb http://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list'
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install jenkins

There would be a home directory created /var/lib/jenkins which would contain all the configuration files in jenkins

 and it also creates a user named as jenkins and service as jenkins
******************************************************************


How we can change the home directory of jenkins

Basically home directory is a place where jenkins store all its files including configuration, information and configuration about plugins and nodes

So in order to move it from the default location (.jenkins or /var/lib/jenkins) we have to do the below steps

create a new folder where you want to move the home directory of jenkins

copy all the previous data in this folder 

and change the the environment variables (JENKINS_HOME)

Windows can be done through control panel and for mac we have to export it through terminal

for mac export=(path for environment variable)

and after this restart jenkins

which can be done localhost:8080/restart or by quitting the terminal and restarting the war file

NOTE :- in mac exporting the environment variable is temp in order to do it for permanent you can go to .bash_profile and add the export line over there

in case .bash_profile file is not there in the user's folder create one, generally this is a hidden file


IMP :- You can also get system information through localhost:8080/systeminfo
