How we can send emails from jenkins for the purpose of emaail notifications

in order to do that we have to go to manage jenkins, configure system and then navigate to email notifications

there we have to provide the SMTP mail server information.

and then select Use SMTP authentication

Once done you have to provide the email address and password from which the notification would be sent out

and we can use this in conjunction with SSL

In case there is any issues check the  email address from which emails are going to be sent out and make sure that less secure apps are allowed
