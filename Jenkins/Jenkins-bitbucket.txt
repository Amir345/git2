In order to start a build after each commit in our repo in bitbucket


In order to trigger build remotely we have to create a webhook from bitbucket repo

and you would need a public IP address in order to achieve that

and you have to make sure that you have bitbucket plugin is installed on jenkins

this plugin would identify that jenkins is listening to bitbucket

In order to create webhook you have to go into settings in bitbucket and then provide the URL for your jenkins and then append 

"bitbucket-hook"
