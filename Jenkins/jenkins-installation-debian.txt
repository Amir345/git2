In order to install Jenkins on a debian ditsro 

we have to first install Java (open JDK and JRE)

post that you have to add jenkins repository and then through that repo we can install jenkins through the repo

In order to install JDK and JRE

#sudo apt-get install openjdk7-jre

now we will install JDK

sudo apt-get install openjdk7-jdk

Now if the java is installed we can check if Java is installed by the below command

java -version

Once Java is installed we have to add the security key for jenkins apt-get repository to our system


# Download the security key for the Jenkins repository & add it to the keychain
wget -q -O - https://jenkins-ci.org/debian/jenkins-ci.org.key | sudo apt-key add -

# Add the Jenkins sources to apt
sudo sh -c 'echo deb http://pkg.jenkins-ci.org/debian binary/ > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list'

# Update the list of packages
sudo apt-get update

# Install Jenkins (will also install its dependencies, eg OpenJDK)
sudo apt-get install jenkins

Note :- When you install Jenkins it would automatically start it as a service and the folder path would be /var/lib/jenkins
