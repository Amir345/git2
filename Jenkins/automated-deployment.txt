Continuous delivery is the continuos deivery of the softwrare

Steps involved in Continuous delivery

Build
Deploy
Test
Release

And all these stages has jobs running and all these jobs are changed

at the end of every job notification should be sent out which tells us about the status of the jobs

*************************************

A real world project

Developer will develop and then commit their code to any VCS 

We will have a build job running on jenkins that will poll SCM or it can be scheduled

Outcome of the build job will be the project artifact which is generally a war or er file

that we will deploy to the servers

Next steps would include deploying it 

which would be done by the deplooy jobs and the artifacts build will be deployed on different kinds of environment 

Once the deployment jobs would be complted we will run different test jobs and then once test job is completed and is successfull we will deploy it on the production is environment

************************************

Automated deployment is the process of automating the deployment process in a continuous delivery system


***********************************

In order to deploy software to any server we have to have deploy plugin to be installed on the machine

It takes war/ear file and deploys that to a running remote application server at the end of each build

supported containers are

Tomcat,Jboss,Glassfish

In order to deploy something we have to deploy war/ear to container we have to go through post build actions

Note :- In case you are deploying it on tomcat you have to edit the file

tomcat-users.xml file in the conf folder

add the user and provide the manager script role

and then restart the tomcat server

Manager username and password in the jenkins jobs would be the details of the user that is added to the tomcat-users file with manager script role

***********************************

In case you use jenkins and tomcat on the same machine use different ports
