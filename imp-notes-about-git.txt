difference between git pull is that it pulls all the changed files in the master 

where in git fetch saves it somewhere else other than your current working directory

so in order to add those changes you have to merge those with the master

git pull = git fetch+git merge


imp :- when we commit using git commit -a -m we don't have to explicitally add the file to the staging area for tracked version of file

in order to merge changes you should checkout to the branch where in you want to merge and then do a git merge

In order to revert the changes that you have committed but not pushed 

we can do that through the below command

git checkout <8digits of SHA commit> <name of the file>
