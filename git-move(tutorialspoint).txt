In order to move a file we have to use the mv comand

once the file is moved we don't have to do git add as folder which is created is already in the staging area 

In order to make changes we just have to commit our changes and push it to the remote server

Note :- if multiple users are working in the same branch they will not see the modified directory structure as thier local repo branch history is not in sync with the remote branch

hence as usual they have to do a git pull

In case of error

git fetch
git merge --allow-unrelated-histories
