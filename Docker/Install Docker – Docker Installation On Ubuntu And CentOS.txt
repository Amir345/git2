Installing docker is just a piece of cake, you just need to run few commands and you’re done!

Docker installation On Ubuntu

# sudo apt-get update  (Update the packages)


before installing docker, I need to install the recommended packages. For that, just type in the below command:

# sudo apt-get install linux-image-extra-$(uname -r) linux-image-extra-virtual -y

Once we are done with pre requisites we have to install the docker engine

# sudo apt-get install docker-engine -y

Once the package is installed we have to start the service

# sudo service docker start

Docker is successfully installed on the machine now you can pull images from docker hub, create containers from the images also you can build your custom images through docker file

NOTE :- Docker user is equivalent to root user hence in order to add up to the security

Create a group named as docker and add your users to that group

# groupadd <docker>
# usermod -aG docker <$nameoftheuser> 

In order to add the current user to the group

sudo gpasswd -a $USER docker
