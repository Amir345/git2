Whatever you do inside a container is not saved until you commit those changes

For example

if you have an image and you run a container based on that image

and you install couple of packages in it and it works

however if you exit the container and run the container again from the images the changes that we made is not there, because that is another instance for the container

So in order for the changes to persist you have to commit those changes as a new image
