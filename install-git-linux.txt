Installing Git on a linux machine

First we need to install the software that Git depends on

#sudo yum groupinstall "Development Tools" -y

# sudo yum install gettext-devel openssl-devel perl-CPAN perl-devel zlib-devel

 we are going to use wget command to download a specific version of Git.

#sudo yum install wget -y

#wget https://github.com/git/git/archive/v2.7.2.tar.gz -O git.tar.gz


#tar -zxf git.tar.gz

Now lets change the directory to Git.

Use the command #cd git

We are in the source folder we can begin the source build process. For that first type in the command:

#make configure

then run #./configure --prefix=/usr/local

Now that the software is built and ready to run, the files can be copied to their final destinations. Use the command below:

#sudo make install

Create a key pair put the public key on git hub and add the private key in the ssh-agent

This can be done by the below command

To add SSH key to the SSH agent we will use

ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
