Stashing is useful where in you are working on something and you want to keep aside your day work without committing them and work on something else

you run the command git stash, this will save your work without commiting them and once done you can always get the work back with the command 

git stash pop

In Git, the stash operation takes your modified tracked files, stages changes, and saves them on a stack of unfinished changes that you can reapply at any time.

You can also view a list of stashed changes by using the git stash list command.
