Merging conflicts

central repo workflow

Whenever multiple collaborators are working on a centralized repo then while pushing a change if someone already changed the same file it would result in conflict

In order to resolve the conflict we can directly pull in the changes but that would overwrite what we made

So we use pull with rebase

what essentially rebase does it will always have the commit from the central repo and add up your local commit on top of that

git pull --rebase origin master

Once done it will show the file which has the conflict

In case you don't see the conflicting file just type git status

In order to solve the conflict we have to use 

git mergetool

and once conflict is sorted out

git rebase --continue

feature branch workflow

In this workflow every feature would be done on a separate branch and once you have done that you can initiate a pull request so that reviewers can review and after discussion you can merge it with the master branch
