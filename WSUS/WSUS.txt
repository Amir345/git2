WSUS is used to provide updates to computers in your organisation.

It allows you to download the updates from the microsoft servers and store them locally, this way rather than every computer contact microsoft servers for updates you can provide those updates through WSUS that are stores locally within the internal network

You can also configure other WSUS servers to download updates from WSUS server, check your network topology while placing the WSUS servers

You can also configure WSUS to determine which updates the computer should install so technically it determines how updates are installed in your organization. and it also optimizes the downloads of your updates

In order to control how updates are installed in the organization you put computer in groups

generally there are three groups (test,pilot,production)


*********************************************************************************

Software pre-requiste to install WSUS

.net framework 2.0
to store the data required to store the updates you need a database, for small installs of WSUS you can use the windows internal data-base in case it is large it can be used in conjunction with SQL server

it also need mmc 3.0

also to generate reports in case you need microsoft reports viewer redistributable 2008(this can be ignore or can be installed later on)

You also need IIS 6.0 or greater, certain componenets are also required (ASP.net/Windows authentication/Dynamic content compression)

ASP.net :- web application component
Windows authentication :- allows client to be authenticated by WSUs when requesting updates
Dynamic content compression :- reduce the size of webpages

*********************************************************************************

Hardware requirement

system partition and WSUS partition should be on NTFS and WSUS partition should not be a compressed drive

1 GB free on system partition, 2 GB on database and 30 GB for updates

*********************************************************************************

WSUS can  be installed directly from the internet or from the server manager. If server manager does not shows up you have to do a windows update

also one should consider what kind of updates you need to dowload. windows updates provides updates for OS and other microsoft office products

Note :- if you configure another wsus server to download updates from WSUS server. You can only retrieve the updates that WSUS has..


**********************************************************************************

While installing WSUS through server manager all the configuration is done

also in large organization generall WSUS server that has internet connectivity will be on a DMZ network and the production WSUS server would be a replica of the WSUS server which is on the DMZ network

you can also configure WSUS as an autonomous what this essentially means is that it will download the updates from other WSUS server but it would be determined by the local admins on that server whether to install it or not.

**********************************************************************************

In order to administer WSUS allows you to create groups, you can also integrate WSUS with group policy for better management


you can create as many groups as you want and assign computer to these group and then you can decide what and how updates would be installed on which group

there are technically two ways to achieve this

Server-side targeting:- perform through the WSUS admin tool this process is manual and is not feasable on large networks

Client side targeting :- client decides which group the computer will be assigned to and is usuallt done through GPO, using GPO you can setup the group membership in your domain

*********************************************************************************

In order to configure Server-side-targeting we have to edit the local gpo of the machine 

Under computer configuration-->admin templates -->windows update--> specify how updates and then update the group policy

what this eventually would do is update the computer agains the WSUS server

Note :- wuauclt /resetauthorization /detect now this will foce the client to register to the WSUS server
