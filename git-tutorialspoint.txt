Version Control System (VCS) is a software that helps software developers to work together and maintain a complete history of their work.

Listed below are the functions of a VCS:

Allows developers to work simultaneously.
Does not allow overwriting each other’s changes.
Maintains a history of every version.

git is a distributed version control system

Centralized version control system (CVCS) uses a central server to store all files and enables team collaboration. But the major drawback of CVCS is its single point of failure

DVCS clients not only check out the latest snapshot of the directory but they also fully mirror the repository. If the server goes down, then the repository from any client can be copied back to the server to restore it. Every checkout is a full backup of the repository. Git does not rely on the central server and that is why you can perform many operations when you are offline. You can commit changes, create branches, view logs, and perform other operations when you are offline. You require network connection only to publish your changes and take the latest changes.

Advantages of Git

Free and open source

Fast and small

Implicit backup

Security

No need of powerful hardware at the central server

Easier branching as compared tp CVCS


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

clone :- creates a clone of the repo and also checkout that repo, you can di whatever you feel like with this repo

pull :- sync changes with the remote repo to the local one

push :- push the changes from local to remote

HEAD :- HEAD is a pointer, which always points to the latest commit in the branch. Whenever you make a commit, HEAD is updated with the latest commit. The heads of the branches are stored in .git/refs/heads/ directory.

Revision :- Revision represents the version of the source code. Revisions in Git are represented by commits.
