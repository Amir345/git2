Patch is a text file, whose contents are similar to Git diff, but along with code, it also has metadata about commits; e.g., commit ID, date, commit message, etc. We can create a patch from commits and other people can apply them to their repository.

One can create a patch and then send that patch to other users and these users can apply the patch on their local repo 

To create a patch git format-patch for the latest commit

you can also specify a commit id if you want to create a patch for that commit.

The above command creates .patch files inside the current working directory. 

now this patch can be send over to other user to apply the patch 

patches can be applied through two commands

git am git apply

git aplly :- applies the patch to the local repo without creating a commit

git am :- applies the patch and creates the commit at the same time
